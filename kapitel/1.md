<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>

<h4 id="jam">Jam</h4>

<p>Today was a warm and sunny morning, so Little Frog put on her BIG sun hat. It had a wide brim and was very pointy. Well,
in truth, it was quite crinkly because Little Frog had sat on it too many times and now the point stuck out to the side.
But Little Frog didn’t mind. She thought it was just perfect for a sunny day.</p>

<p>With her hat on, she stepped out of her cosy house and onto her front lily pad to enjoy the morning outside. You see,
Little Frog lived in a small mound, overgrown with reeds, and it was right at the edge of a beautiful pond.</p>

<p>There were two round windows in her cottage and a round door between them. The door was yellow because yellow was Little
Frog’s favourite colour.</p>

<p>The cup in her hand was also yellow and full of tea. It was also very, very big. Little Frog didn’t believe in small
cups, you see. There just wasn’t enough space for all her yummy tea in them.</p>

<p>On the edge of Little Frog’s lily pad was a big pale pink flower. It was the perfect size for Little Frog to sit in. She
could even paddle her feet in the warm water. The best spot to spend the morning.</p>

<p>A lot of Little Frog’s friends lived at the pond too. There was a sleepy orange butterfly called Nici, who flew by to
say hi and bring the mail every morning. There was the pond snail Alis, who often drifted by while chomping on a leaf or
some water plants. She was usually too busy for a chat though. And there was the water strider Gerrid. He loved to stop
by for a
chat.</p>

<p>“Good morning Little Frog. How is your day?”<br>
“Perfectly splendid Gerrid!” said Little Frog with a wide smile. “I see you’ve got some mail.<br>
Who is it from?”<br>
Gerrid waved the letter excitedly. “My aunt is visiting next week.”<br>
“Oh wonderful, I like her.” Little Frog clapped her hands in delight.<br>
“Yes, I thought we could come to visit you again.”<br>
“Most certainly. I will make some of your aunt’s favourite jam, shall I?”</p>

<p>Gerrid hopped excitedly. “That would be great! But now I must stride on and get everything ready.”</p>

<p>Little Frog waved him off.</p>

 
<p>After finishing her tea, Little Frog collected her large wicker backpack and set off to collect some blackberries for her jam. Little Frog's jam was said to be the best in the whole valley, you know.</p>
 
<p>She walked through the high reeds around her house and then along a small path across a meadow. Around her grew buttercups, dandelions and forget-me-nots. Even a few poppies swayed softly in the breeze. Little Frog breathed in their sweet smell and smiled. She enjoyed strolling through the meadows; it was so beautiful here.</p>
 
<p>Soon she arrived at the treeline where a big bramble bush stood. It was a high tangle of green leaves and red and black berries. Circling around it, Little Frog found the entrance to a small tunnel. Above it was a beautifully painted sign that said ‘Blackberry Orchard’ in big letters and underneath, ‘The sweetest berries in the vole world’.<br>
Little Frog chuckled. The voles were renowned for their puns and little jokes. She stepped through the carefully woven tunnel. The brambles were intertwined in intricate patterns arching above her and forming a beautiful passageway.<br>
On the other side the sun warmed a large clearing surrounded by high curving walls of leaves and berries. “Hello Lina.” Little Frog called up to the small vole clambering between the brambles.<br>
“Oh hello Little Frog! I’ll be down in a second.” A bundle of dry branches and leaves sailed down, landing neatly next to a big red cushion.</p>
 
<p>Shortly after, the little brown mouse jumped down onto the soft red fabric. She was wearing big gardening gloves and dangling off her belt was a large pair of garden shears.</p>
 
<p>“Nice to see you.” said Lina, dusting herself off.</p>
 
<p>Little Frog put down her big wicker backpack. “I’m here to collect some blackberries for jam.”<br>
“Oh how wonderful!“ Lina exclaimed „If you make too much by accident, we would love to take a jar off your hands.” She winked and Little Frog chuckled. “I’ll pick enough blackberries to make a whole cauldron full.”</p>
 
<p>“The best ones at the moment are over there. Just give me a shout when you're done, then we'll have some tea.” And with that, Lina scrambled back up into the bush, happily bustling about among the leaves.</p>
 
<p>Little Frog walked over to the spot Lina had indicated, placed a red cushion under it and carefully climbed into the brambles. The voles did a great job of taming the blackberry bush, so it was very easy and safe to climb. Little Frog could wander about and choose the perfect blackberries in peace.</p>
 
<p>When she was done, there were six BIG shiny black berries in her wicker backpack, filling it up to the brim. Little Frog closed the basket and met Lina at a green door shaped like a leaf. It led into a big room woven tightly from brambles. Two comfy settees stood in one corner; opposite was a big table and a warm stove. Colin, Lina’s partner, stood at the stove backing a pie.</p>
 
<p>“Little Frog, what a nice surprise! Sit down, sit down, I’ll make some tea.” He bustled off and in no time they were all sitting on the sofas, drinking tea and eating cake.</p>

<p>After they’d finished their tea, Little Frog thanked them, put her crinkled but still pointy sun hat back on and made her way home to the pond.</p>


<p>When she arrived, she put two of the big blackberries into her storage cabinet, nestled between dried herbs, mushrooms and an assortment of accurately labelled jars.</p>


<p>She took out her biggest cauldron, hung it in the fireplace and started on the jam. Little Frog liked making jam. She liked chopping the fruit and stirring the cauldron, and she especially loved the smell.</p>


<p>The slowly setting sun glinted on the empty jam jars that she lined up on the table to label with blackberry shaped stickers. 
She portioned the jam into fifteen jars and licked the cauldron and the spoon clean. This was her favourite part. She washed all her tools and let them dry beside the fire.</p>


<p>Five of the jam jars she put into her cupboard, four she packed into a basket to take to the voles, three she left on the counter for when the water striders visited, two she put up on the shelf to give out as presents, and one she left on the table for her supper.</p>


<p>With a content sigh, Little Frog sat down at her table with fresh bread, honey, jam and hazelnut butter. The day was already nearing its end and Little Frog was hungry from her work.</p>


<p>When she was full, Little Frog made herself a very big cup of tea and went outside. The sky was already turning dark as she sat in her soft water lily on the edge of her lily pad and paddled her feet gently in the water.</p>


<p>Around her, the bustle of the day quieted down and the slow peaceful evening set in. A few reeds along, the toad and grasshopper choir met for their weekly practice and they sang the most beautiful starlight tunes.</p>


<p>Slowly the fireflies awoke and went about their business, soon accompanied by the stars and the moon in the now deep blue sky.</p>


<p>Little Frog breathed in the cool night air and relaxed while the peaceful songs of the night wove around her.</p>
