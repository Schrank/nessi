<p>Was hat es mit dieser E-Mail Liste auf sich?</p>

<p>Nun, ich habe festgestellt, dass es zu wenig GUTEnachtgeschichten gibt, die für sorgenvolle Menschen gedacht sind.
Also habe ich angefangen eine Folge an Kurzgeschichten zu schreiben, in denen alles in Ordnung ist.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/little-frog.jpg" alt="image" class="pull-right"></p>

<p>Es geht um Kleiner Frosch, wie sie ihr gemütliches Leben lebt und mit ihren Freunden Spaß hat. Die Geschichten sind ein
sicherer Ort, etwas, das man lesen kann, um den Gedanken zu entkommen, frei von Problemen.</p>

<p>Diese Geschichten teile ich über meine E-Mail Liste, sowie ein bis zwei begleitende Bilder und ein paar Zeilen darüber,
welche Projekte ich sonst so gerade in Angriff nehme. Ab und an werde ich auch Umfragen verschicken, bei denen ihr bei
neuen Ideen und
Charakteren mitwirken könnt, wenn ihr möchtet.<br>
Ich werde die Geschichten auch als Hörbücher einsprechen, die könnt ihr auf meinem Youtube Kanal … finden 💚.</p>

<p>Die Geschichten werde ich vorerst nur auf Englisch schreiben.<br>
Damit ihr auch wisst auf was ihr euch einlasst ist hier der Anfang des ersten Kapitels. Den Rest bekommt ihr in der
ersten Email 😉</p>

<p>So what’s the deal with this email list?</p>
<p>Well, I noticed that there are too few goodnight stories suited for people that feel anxious. So I started to write a series of short stories in which nothing bad ever happens.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/little-frog.jpg" alt="image" class="pull-right"></p>

<p>Little Frog is the main character, who has a cosy life and loads of fun with her friends. The stories are a safe place, something you can read to calm down, free of problems.</p>

<p>I share these stories through my email list plus accompanying pictures and a few lines about my current projects. Every now and then I’ll share a small survey through which you can contribute to new ideas and characters if you want.
I will also record the stories as audiobooks, which you can find on my youtube channel … 💚</p>

<p>For now the stories will only be available in English.
You can read the start of chapter one below, so you know what to expect.
The rest will be in the first Email 😉</p>

<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>

<h4 id="jam">Jam</h4>

<p>Today was a warm and sunny morning, so Little Frog put on her BIG sun hat. It had a wide brim and was very pointy. Well,
in truth, it was quite crinkly because Little Frog had sat on it too many times and now the point stuck out to the side.
But Little Frog didn’t mind. She thought it was just perfect for a sunny day.</p>

<p>With her hat on, she stepped out of her cosy house and onto her front lily pad to enjoy the morning outside. You see,
Little Frog lived in a small mound, overgrown with reeds, and it was right at the edge of a beautiful pond.</p>

<p>There were two round windows in her cottage and a round door between them. The door was yellow because yellow was Little
Frog’s favourite colour.</p>

<p>The cup in her hand was also yellow and full of tea. It was also very, very big. Little Frog didn’t believe in small
cups, you see. There just wasn’t enough space for all her yummy tea in them.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/LFHousPond.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>On the edge of Little Frog’s lily pad was a big pale pink flower. It was the perfect size for Little Frog to sit in. She
could even paddle her feet in the warm water. The best spot to spend the morning.</p>

<p>A lot of Little Frog’s friends lived at the pond too. There was a sleepy orange butterfly called Nici, who flew by to
say hi and bring the mail every morning. There was the pond snail Alis, who often drifted by while chomping on a leaf or
some water plants. She was usually too busy for a chat though. And there was the water strider Gerrid. He loved to stop
by for a
chat.</p>

<p>“Good morning Little Frog. How is your day?”<br>
“Perfectly splendid Gerrid!” said Little Frog with a wide smile. “I see you’ve got some mail.<br>
Who is it from?”<br>
Gerrid waved the letter excitedly. “My aunt is visiting next week.”<br>
“Oh wonderful, I like her.” Little Frog clapped her hands in delight.<br>
“Yes, I thought we could come to visit you again.”<br>
“Most certainly. I will make some of your aunt’s favourite jam, shall I?”</p>

<p>Gerrid hopped excitedly. “That would be great! But now I must stride on and get everything ready.”</p>

<p>Little Frog waved him off.</p>
